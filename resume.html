            <h2>Life Experience</h2>
            <p>I've had quite different life experience when compared to the typically person my age. Firstly, I was
                homeschooled until I was nearly 17.</p>
            <p>This has given we a rather unique perspective compared to someone who's gone through the school-system, I
                always managed myself. This has taught me a lot about working hard, working smarter instead of harder
                when possible and has
                given me a lot of freedom to study subjects that most people never got the chance to.</p>
            <p>I've also lived in 3 different countries, including the UK, New Zealand and Australia. Having seen so
                many places, I've come to appreciate the good things about everywhere.</p>

            <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
            <p>I'm a Student Developer studying at Tafe. I started programming when I was 15, after I had finished my
                IGCSE Maths exams. To begin with, I followed an online Python course, but after a couple of weeks I
                found it was going way too slow and simplistic so I went and did my own thing. This lead to me spending
                my first couple of years programming almost entirely self-taught, with only Youtube and documentation as
                my teachers. Now in 2024, I've been taking a Certificate IV in Programming from Tafe to solidify my
                understanding of the fundamentals, as well as trying a bunch of different fields in programming to find
                what interests me. Next year I hope to do a double diploma in Advanced Programming and Backend Web
                Development.</p>
            <p>Before Tafe, I was always homeschooled. This meant usually involved me working through the same or
                similar textbooks to other people my age, but at my own pace and in my own way. Normally, people take
                their GCSE's at around 16 all at once. Due to the flexibility of being homeschooled, I was able to start
                when I was 14, and finish when I was 16. This let me focus on subjects one at a time instead of studying
                8 different things at once. Being homeschooled also gave my the freedom to choose a lot of the subjects
                I studied, such as Ancient History and Classical Civilisation, which are unavailable to most people.</p>
